# First DAPP with Ethereum

The objective of this project is to study about [ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/), [solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io) and [web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io) creating a Decentralized Application using [RemixIDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) to compile and deploy the contracts to a local development network created by [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli).

As I didn't use any framework as React, Vue or Angular I took the opportunity to play around ES module on browser =)
